## Scrum Events

### Sprint Planning
1. Sprint goal - Business and technical goal for the sprint. Allows us to negotiate the scope of the sprint in case we find out that something is more complex than expected during the sprint
2. Sprint backlog - Measure user stories with Fibonacci sequence
3. Team commitment - Clarify if anyone is unavailable during the sprint . Is someone on holiday? Are there public holidays during the sprint?
4.	Team velocity - Approximate appetite of user stories able to commit for the sprint based on resources availability
5.	Individual capacity - Developers and QA will be full time, meanwhile leads will be half-time operational work

### Daily Scrum
1.	What did I do yesterday?
2.	What will I do today?
3.	What will I achieve today?
4.	Anything blocking your progress?
    - Person-in-charge
    - Issue statement
    - Target resolution date

### Sprint Review
1.	Informal session between scrum team, PO and/or stakeholders to show on the work completed to ensure Sprint Goal is met
2.	State what will (and what will not) be demonstrated
3.	Scrum team to demo new functionality
4.	Product Owner and/or stakeholders to provide feedback (if any) 

### Sprint Retrospective
1. **Loved** - List what you loved about your work
2. **Longed** for - List what you wished you had while working
3. **Loathed** - List what you didn't like about your work
4. **Learned** - List what you learned
5. Action items - How should the next sprint play out? This will determine corrective actions to take in the next sprint, preventing the same mistakes from occurring, and making successful actions a repeatable outcome.
